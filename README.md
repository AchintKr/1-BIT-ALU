This project presents the design and implementation of a 1-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) employing a novel approach that integrates five 2-to-4 decoders and additional logic gates. The 1-bit ALU serves as a fundamental building block in digital circuits, facilitating essential arithmetic and logical operations. The utilization of multiple 2-to-4 decoders offers a unique strategy for input selection, allowing dynamic routing of data bits based on control signals. Complemented by carefully designed additional logic gates, the ALU can perform various operations, including addition, subtraction, AND, OR .

The proposed design leverages the inherent capabilities of 2-to-4 decoders to efficiently decode control signals, directing input bits to specific arithmetic or logical pathways. Additional logic gates, including AND, OR, and NOT gates, are strategically incorporated to realize the desired operations on the selected inputs. This approach contributes to a modular and scalable design, offering flexibility and ease of integration into larger digital systems.

Simulation results demonstrate the functionality and reliability of the 1-bit ALU across diverse input combinations and control signals. The design's efficiency is further highlighted through its ability to execute a range of operations while minimizing hardware complexity. The modular nature of the implemented design, along with the use of 2-to-4 decoders, makes it suitable for various applications, including microprocessors, digital signal processors, and other integrated circuits.

This work not only provides insights into an unconventional 1-bit ALU design but also underscores the potential of harnessing decoder-based input selection for enhanced flexibility and modularity in digital circuitry. Future work may explore optimizations, scalability for multi-bit ALUs, and integration into more complex digital architectures.
